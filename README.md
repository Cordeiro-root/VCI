### Paper review
In the [Paper Review folder](https://github.com/Cordeiro-root/VCI/tree/master/Paper%20Review) you can find all the materials we used for the paper review. 
Instead, [this is the link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zD94taaeZvWQRtxkT_ir4Kk1xHnKp3frgIj0s6lziBg/edit?usp=sharing) to the Powerpoint presentation.

### Project
In the [Pratica G4 folder](https://github.com/Cordeiro-root/VCI/tree/master/Pratica%20G4) you can find all our code for the five deliverables of the project. In order to be able to run it, you need to install:

 1) **Python**: you can install it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or, if you prefer, you can download the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) data science toolkit, which aleady provides you with libraries such as Numpy, also required;
 2) **OpenCV**: this library is fundamental for computer vision. It provides plenty of functions that are used in the code. You can download it from the [official website](https://opencv.org/) or you may want to use the very easy to install unofficial package, using the following command from the Python environment: ``` pip install opencv-python ```;
 3) **TensorFlow** and **Keras**: in the 4th deliverable, in order to use machine learning you have to be able to use functions from these two libraries, also downloadable through the ``` pip install ... ``` command.

Every deliverable has its own subfolder inside Pratica G4: you can find the documentation related with them inside each subfolder.
