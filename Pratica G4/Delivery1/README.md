### Deliverable 1; Video capture, color calibrationa and watermark

The first deliverable, we where able to concatenate every point into one file, ``` deliverable_1.py ```.
In order to use the program, simply use ``` python deliverable_1.py ```, then you need to choose if you want to record a video or play a existing one, play with the Contrast, Brightness and Saturation parameters. 
Follow the instructions to save the record or to quit the video.

We also have a lot off test files, where we try the various points like capture video, save and read, color calibration, and watermark before we reach the final result.
